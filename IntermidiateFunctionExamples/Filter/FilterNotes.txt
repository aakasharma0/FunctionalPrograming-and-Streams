JAVA STREAM filter() — INTERVIEW NOTES

1) What is filter()?
- filter() is an INTERMEDIATE stream operation.
- It is used to SELECT elements based on a condition.
- It uses a Predicate (returns boolean).

2) Method signature
Stream<T> filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate)

3) How filter() works
- Each element is passed to the Predicate.
- If Predicate returns true → element continues in the stream.
- If Predicate returns false → element is discarded.

4) Execution behavior
- filter() is LAZY.
- It does NOT execute until a terminal operation is called.
- It processes elements ONE BY ONE (not in batch).

5) Effect on source
- filter() does NOT modify the original collection.
- It creates a new stream pipeline.

6) Performance characteristics
- Supports short-circuiting.
- Stops processing early when used with:
  findFirst(), anyMatch(), limit()

7) Multiple filters
- Multiple filter() calls are merged internally.
- Each element passes through all filters before moving forward.
- No intermediate collections are created.

8) Common interview points
- filter() returns a Stream, not a Collection.
- Predicate must be stateless and side-effect free (recommended).
- filter() alone does nothing without a terminal operation.

9) One-line interview answer
- filter() applies a Predicate to each stream element and retains only those that satisfy the condition.
