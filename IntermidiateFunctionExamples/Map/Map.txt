JAVA STREAM map() — INTERVIEW NOTES

1) What is map()?
- map() is an INTERMEDIATE stream operation.
- It is used to TRANSFORM each element in a stream.
- One input element produces exactly ONE output element.

2) Method signature
<R> Stream<R> map(Function<? super T, ? extends R> mapper)

3) How map() works
- Takes one element from the stream.
- Applies the Function.
- Emits the transformed element downstream.
- Repeats for each element.

4) Execution behavior
- map() is LAZY.
- Executes only when a terminal operation is invoked.
- Processes elements ONE BY ONE.

5) Key characteristics
- map() does NOT filter elements.
- map() does NOT flatten elements.
- map() does NOT modify the source collection.
- Output stream size == input stream size.

6) Common use cases
- Converting types (Entity → DTO)
- Extracting fields (Object → field)
- Applying calculations (x → x * 2)
- Formatting data (Object → String)

7) map() vs filter()
- map(): transforms data
- filter(): selects data

map() always produces an output element.

8) map() vs flatMap()
- map(): one-to-one transformation
- flatMap(): one-to-many transformation + flattening

9) Performance characteristics
- Lightweight operation.
- Stateless (does not store history).
- Can be safely used in parallel streams.

10) Common interview pitfalls
- Using map() for side effects (wrong)
- Expecting map() to remove elements
- Returning null unintentionally
- Confusing map() with flatMap()

11) One-line interview answer
- map() applies a Function to each stream element and transforms it into a new element.
