JAVA Consumer — INTERVIEW NOTES

1) What is Consumer?
- Consumer is a FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE in java.util.function.
- It represents an OPERATION that consumes input.
- It takes ONE input and RETURNS NOTHING.

- Designed for side-effect operations

5) Where Consumer is used
- Stream.forEach()
- Optional.ifPresent()
- Collection.forEach()
- Callbacks and event handling

6) Execution behavior
- Consumer executes only when accept() is called.
- In streams, executed during terminal operation.

7) Consumer chaining (IMPORTANT)
- andThen(Consumer<? super T> after)
- Executes consumers sequentially.

Meaning:
consumer1.andThen(consumer2)

8) Consumer vs others
- Consumer → perform action
- Predicate → check condition
- Function → transform value
- Supplier → produce value

9) Consumer in Streams
- forEach() internally calls consumer.accept(element).
- Used at the END of stream pipelines.

10) Common interview mistakes
