JAVA Predicate — INTERVIEW NOTES

1) What is Predicate?
- Predicate is a FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE in java.util.function.
- It represents a CONDITION or TEST.
- It takes ONE input and returns a BOOLEAN.

2) Method signature
boolean test(T t)

3) Purpose of Predicate
- Used to check whether an element satisfies a condition.
- Commonly used for filtering logic.

4) Where Predicate is used
- Stream.filter()
- Collection removeIf()
- Optional.filter()
- Custom conditional logic

5) Execution behavior
- Predicate itself does NOT execute anything.
- It is executed when called by a method like filter() or test().

6) Predicate and Streams
- filter() internally calls predicate.test(element).
- If true → element is allowed.
- If false → element is rejected.

7) Predicate chaining methods (IMPORTANT)
- and(Predicate other)
- or(Predicate other)
- negate()

Example logic:
p1.and(p2) → both true
p1.or(p2) → any true
p1.negate() → reverse result

8) Predicate characteristics
- Stateless (recommended)
- Side-effect free (best practice)
- Reusable

9) Predicate vs Function vs Consumer
- Predicate → test condition → boolean
- Function → transform value → output
- Consumer → perform action → no output

10) Predicate with custom objects
- Uses object fields inside test().
- Works independently of equals() / hashCode().

11) Common interview mistakes
- Using Predicate for transformation (wrong)
- Putting side effects inside Predicate
- Forgetting Predicate returns boolean

12) One-line interview answer
- Predicate represents a boolean-valued function used to test conditions on objects.
