JAVA STREAM distinct() — INTERVIEW NOTES

1) What is distinct()?
- distinct() is an INTERMEDIATE stream operation.
- It removes DUPLICATE elements from a stream.
- It returns a stream containing only UNIQUE elements.

2) How distinct() decides uniqueness
- For OBJECT streams:
  → Uses equals() and hashCode()
- For PRIMITIVE streams (IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream):
  → Uses value equality

3) Method signature
Stream<T> distinct()

4) Execution behavior
- distinct() is LAZY.
- It executes only when a terminal operation is invoked.
- Elements are processed one by one.

5) Internal working (high level)
- Internally uses a HashSet to track already-seen elements.
- If an element is already present → it is discarded.
- First occurrence is kept, later duplicates are removed.

6) Ordering behavior
- For ORDERED streams (like List):
  → Preserves encounter order.
- For UNORDERED streams:
  → Order is not guaranteed.

7) Effect on source data
- distinct() does NOT modify the original collection.
- It creates a new stream pipeline.

8) Usage with custom objects
- Must override equals() and hashCode().
- Without proper overrides, distinct() may not work as expected.

9) distinct() vs Set
- distinct(): removes duplicates DURING stream processing.
- Set: removes duplicates by storing data.
- distinct() is preferred in stream pipelines.

10) Performance considerations
- Requires additional memory (to track seen elements).
- Works best when used after filter() to reduce data size.

11) One-line interview definition
- distinct() returns a stream consisting of unique elements based on equals() and hashCode() (or value equality for primitives).
