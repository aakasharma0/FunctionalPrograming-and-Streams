Problem:
Given a list of strings, group the strings by their length using Java Streams.

Input:
List<String> names = List.of(
    "Akash",
    "Raj",
    "Amit",
    "John",
    "Ajay"
);

Expected Output:
{
  3 = ["Raj"],
  4 = ["Amit", "John", "Ajay"],
  5 = ["Akash"]
}

Constraints:
- Do not use loops (for / while)
- Do not use external libraries
- Use Java 8 Stream API only

Concepts Tested:
- stream()
- Collectors.groupingBy
- Classifier function
- Map<Integer, List<String>>

How would you group by length and count how many strings are of each length?
